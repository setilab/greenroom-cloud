The Greenroom Cloud Services Platform

This repo contains the code for a management platform for automated greenroom or greenhouse IoT controllers.

The cloud services platform provides apis, website, apps, etc for managing one or more controllers on a subscription basis. Subscriptions will be available in service-level tiers, such as Basic (Free), Advanced, and Professional. Each tier will offer additional capabilities that extend the basic management of the hardware platform. All services supported by the platform are required to be both cloud-native, as well as cloud-agnostic, essentially meaning Kubernetes provides the container orchestration/runtime environment.
